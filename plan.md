# Project Plan

## Overview
Using Vanilla Javascript, I would like an aquarium that represents how I hold my thoughts. 

## Features
1. Input from user becomes its own swimming thought organism
    1. Receive written input
    2. Take audio input 
        1. Voice to Text
        2. Break up each sentence. Detect sentences with a model similar to P5.SpeechRec
    3. Image input
2. All inputs become organisms/fishes in the aquarium that swim at different speeds, directions, routes at random
    1. Sometimes overlapping
    2. Sometimes hiding away
    3. Sometimes going away 
    4. Sometimes coming back
3. All housed within water and tank in defined boundaries
4. Moods will influence the water and tank
    1. Hunger will add a red tinge
    2. Fear will add a green
    3. Desire will add a pink
    4. Calm will be blue (default)
5. Can focus on/magnify certain thoughts
    1. Other thoughts will go away/retreat
    2. Add wave animation on edges of magnification
6. Can release thoughts
    1. Some could come back
    2. Some gone for good
